title: I am up and running!

Finally, I created my own blog running on Github (since the day I used Yahoo 360Blog, lots of memories :) ).

It's about my thought about anything in my life, about programming, life of a programmer, a football(love)er, blah blah blah. 

Thanks,

<b>Hello world, I am up and running! :) </b>
