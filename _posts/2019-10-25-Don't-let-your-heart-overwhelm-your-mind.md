title: Don't let your heart overwhelm your mind
---

Recently, I got a very good oppoturnity for a new change in my career path, a very good offer, I think.
The good change came from a new friend I have never worked together before, never grown up together at any environment before. 

He also works for a software company which is our company's competitor at a football competition.
We have a brief talk after a training match which I played with his colleagues. No interviews, no technical questions. 
"What's your career orientation?", "This is our current working ...". That's all, then we matched. 

He also said that his manager (a women) really like the way I played football. "This guy shows greate determination when playing football, I believe he absolubely a good employee with a very high dedication", said his manager.
So proud of me, haha :))

The reason why I said this is a very good offer, not only the salary but also their works. 
The salary can be a good number for a one-year-after-graduation guy like me. I might need have to take another 4 years working very hard with the current job to catch that dream number. :) 
Regarding the company, a product company. They have a software product/solution for automotive selling management. I used to work at a product company, so there're some reasons why I love working for a product company rather than software oursourcing.

Of course, I didn't not accept the invitation immediately and promised to answer him back later when I can manage my current works.
The biggest reason is the responsibility with the current works, I think, as a FrontEnd developer for a oursourcing project. 
After a lots of workshops and knowledge training, we only have nearly 1 month for the development of phase 1. 
Cannot imagine if I say to the manager to leave the company now. Surely they can find a new stronger man to replace me and take my works here but also surely the managers will have a unfriendly look to me. And I don't want to leave by that way.

I am not hurry to leave, because I am always accept any challenges, I believe and very confident that it's not hard for me to have another oppoturnity like that, as long as I nodded in agreement. Anyway, the world has other interesting things for being discovered. I will leave one day... to find out new challenges as I will never satisfy with what I have achieved, you know.

A short story finally led me think about a thing, "Dont let your heart overwhelm your mind", especially at work. Guest why? ;)

I am loser, I let my mind be overwhelmed by the heart.
